# Camperbot Profile Page

This is a simple HTML project to build a basic profile page for Camperbot. The purpose of this project is to learn how to structure HTML content correctly using headings and paragraph elements.

## Features

- Main heading introducing Camperbot
- Subheading for "About" section
- Paragraph describing Camperbot
- Subheading for "Background and Interests"
- Paragraph describing Camperbot's interests

## Fixed Issues

This version fixes the following errors from the original code:

- Replaced invalid `<heading2>` with valid `<h2>` tags.
- Replaced invalid `<pp>` with valid `<p>` tags.
- Corrected malformed `<h3>` closing tag (`<h3/>` changed to `</h3>`).

## Example Code

```html
<h1>Hello from Camperbot!</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Camperbot and I love learning new things.</p>

<h3>Background and Interests</h3>
<p>I enjoy solving puzzles.</p>
```

## Getting Started

To view the profile page:

1. Copy the HTML code into a `.html` file (e.g., `index.html`)
2. Open the file in a web browser
